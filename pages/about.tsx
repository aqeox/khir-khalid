        “We put our best – my best and his best – when we are at peace. To be
        able to translate and convey our thoughts and vision into imagery that
        define who we are for the past 10 years, is really a big achievement.” –
        ChuanDo & Frey
      </p>

      <p className='paragraph'>
        With a discerning eye for details and aesthetics that translate into
        high-octane images – these are the qualities that best define ChuanDo
        and Frey’s approach to photography.

        Moulded by an art school background and the youngest son of
        distinguished Asian painter Tan Tee Chie, ChuanDo’s journey into
        collaborating and creating arresting images with engineering graduate
        Frey began in 2006.

        L’Officiel & L’Officiel Hommes (Singapore), Harper’s Bazaar (Singapore,
        China, Malaysia, and Thailand), Elle (Singapore, Spain and Czech) and
        Arena (Singapore). As one of their more notable works, ChuanDo and Frey
